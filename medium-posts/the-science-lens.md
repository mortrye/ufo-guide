One of the (many) challenges facing the movement to get to the true bottom of UAPs/UFOs is that there are a number of very smart people who are spreading a certain kind of ignorance about the issue. The arguments you see from these people usually go along the lines of these: flying saucers can't be real because the reports from real life make them out to be just like the spaceships aliens drive around in the movies. And aliens can't be real because the reports always describe them as being just like the aliens we see in the movies. The argument being that we should expect real-life aliens to look more, well, alien. They and their ships should be something we've never imagined before. Something wholly new under (this) sun. That certainly makes rational sense. A good pragmatic approach for smart pragmatic people.

The unfortunate thing is that while that obverse perspective on aliens could be true, the reverse perspective is *equally* true: reports of aliens and UFOs might be so similar to what we see in the movies because *that's what they actually look like*. Not to get on the wrong side of [Neil DeGrasse Tyson](https://www.msnbc.com/the-beat-with-ari/watch/see-neil-degrasse-tyson-debunk-alien-believers-after-biden-pentagon-s-ufo-report-115788869792), but it's pretty easy to imagine that a huge number of reports of unexplained saucer-shaped flying objects, and encounters with small-statured creatures with large heads and eyes could go from reality to fiction just as easily as the other way around. While surely there is some action by which the real-life reports reinforce themselves (the first witness says 'saucer' and the next witness will also say 'saucer' even if it were more cigar-shaped --- this is the nature of language), this is at it's heart a chick-and-egg scenario --- both *could* be true. Except the truth at the bottom is that it is either the chicken *or* the egg, and someday we'll hopefully know whether it's chicken-based fiction-influences-reality or egg-based reality-influences-fiction.

The problem I have is that the chicken-based argument gets all the support from the smart rational-minded people I admire. But I can't help but dwell on the fact that we don't live in a culture that is full of people making radical claims about our fictions coming to life. Nobody is worried the alien from Alien is coming to get us in real life (at least not while awake). Nobody thinks there is a wookie out there waiting to befriend them and go on adventures. If the real-life reports of aliens and UFOs were driven by our fictional versions of them, they why not *all* our fictional aliens? In direct contrast to the 'science' take on this, it seems to me like if real-life reports of aliens were extremely varied and 'alien' *that* would make their existence much less likely. That the opposite is true and the real-life reports all bear a resemblance to the aliens we portray in movies when we want a 'real' alien... that's just eerie.

So the problem is we look to scientists for (true) answers about UFOs, and scientists always give us the chicken-based answer. Why does that happen? Why are scientists seemingly so unimaginative and stubborn? The problem is that scientists are human. We want them to give us a hard-science based opinions about the world but, other than very close work in very narrow fields of empirical study, that's impossible to do. Scientists, even the best of them, use heuristics and story-based internal narratives to view the world. The only difference between scientists and the rest of us saps is that the culture *assumes* scientists have some kind of extra authority because of the supposedly empirical foundations of their opinions. This is so widespread that the scientists themselves come to believe believe their opinions are grounded in rational empiricism, and thus have more truth in them than other people's experiences and opinions. But this isn't science, it's a science *lens* through which they view the world.

Now don't take me to mean that science is all bad. The person who views the world through the science lens does try to hold out a bit more for rationality. And statistics play a much bigger part in the shaping of the science lens than they do for the average person. And, I mean, what else have we got, am-I-right? But scientists take data and rational analysis and make the same mistakes all the rest of us do with our experiences: they create a narrative story; and they process new information by fitting it into the story that shapes what they have experienced in the past (though some of that "experience" is data and research).

The problem with this is that scientists --- just like the rest of us --- then use what they have experienced in the past to do analysis and make predictions about current and future events. Unfortunately for them unlikely and new events happen *all* the effin time. Scientists confidently predicting future events based on past experience are [doomed to have their asses handed to them evenually](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/19/us/elections/electoral-college-results.html). Science views the world through a lens of what is *likely* to be true. This often blinds them to unlikely outcomes (or events, as is the case with UFOs). 

Again and again the world, the universe, has proven to be a much weirder place than any predictive capacity science has. (Even if we acknowledge that capacity has been ever-growing.) Science as a field needs to not only be open to this weirdness, but on the lookout for it. Unfortunately the current scientific climate is to dismiss weirdness barring extraordinary evidence. Instead of adherence to the old maxim, scientists should revel in the weirdness of the world. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary curiosity.
