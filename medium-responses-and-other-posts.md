## Reponses under The existence of UFOs is not about whether aliens exist, itâ€™s about whether FTL travel is possible.

I think the problem at the root of a lot of conversations around UFO/UAPs (both in this comment section and the wider world) is that for more than 100 years science as a discipline has been continuously given the benefit of the doubt. The reality is scientists are no better at even-handedly examining, experimenting on, and adopting unusual claims today that they were 150 years ago when they scoffed at the idea that meteors could originate off-planet.

Even those who believe that a few experts know the truth and are hiding it from the public, or that black ops have all the answers figured out and want to keep the technology to themselves are falling into this trap of assuming that scientists are like actually GOOD at doing science.
I think science is far more influenced by squishy human concerns like cultural interests, political pressures, career advancement, and (seriously) pop culture than any scientist would ever care to admit. Rational, open-minded examination of evidence plays only the tiniest part in the decisions scientists make about what to study and how.

This, I think, is at the heart of why we know nothing about UFOs/UAPs -- "scientific" culture got in the way of actually considering the evidence. I think this is MUCH more of a problem than what the government isn't telling us.

Until science as a discipline starts to broadly integrate qualities of humility, curiosity, open-mindedness, and the recognition that being an expert is the _beginning_ of knowing something about a subject not the end, until then we will continue to face frustrating stone-walling and cultural obstacles to studying all sorts of the radically weird stuff that's going on in the world, and scientists will continue to have their asses handed to them when they make predictions and analysis based on what they think they know. (See 2016 election.)

You know what's fun? Faking UFO photos! Though I obviously lean into the making of funny, obviously-fake photos.

Good point. I guess just for the sake of simplicity I was lumping any method of travel that gets around the sheer time/distance problem of space as "FTL." But it's true that a "drive" that allows a vessel to move above light speed is not the only way to travel. (Though, I think, maybe the most exciting for those of us dreaming of the sci-fi future.)

There's also the chance that someone relatively close by -- say mere decades at sub-light speeds -- decided to send a ship or probe to check us out. But what a mundane idea! Travel through space by sheer perseverance and patience? Who wants to do that just to see what Netflix is line on another planet?

I was really disappointed to read this comment because it means I failed to make the point I was trying for. I think you are coming from a place that many (many) scientists come from on this topic, which is based on the assumption that if the aliens are here, why haven't they landed on the white house lawn and popped to hatch to say hello?

But that is exactly the kind of distorted cultural lens I'm talking about. For aliens to feel like they should say hello (or, as in the example you mention, reveal their technology) assumes that they have any notion that they want to or should try to communicate with us. But that's such an obvious fallacy: We have yet to have a conversation with any other species from our *own* planet, why do scientists assume we would be able to have any kind of meaningful communication with extra-terrestrials? (The reason they make that assumption is because they have watch too many Hollywood depictions of aliens, I think.)

Just as we have no impulse to reveal or hide our technology to ants, (https://mortrye.medium.com/why-havent-the-aliens-said-hello-because-to-them-we-re-about-the-equivalent-of-ants-136d5d01b26c) it's no stretch of the imagination to acknowledge the possibility that aliens could be working with technology that is both difficult for us to detect, and at the same time they are making no effort to hide the stuff. 

It is entirely possible that we just don't mean very much at all to aliens, other than for some basic scientific observation on their part. They may have nothing to say to us, no message of peace or war, no feelings about us at all. I get it that as a culture that would be hard for us to accept, and would make for a lousy Hollywood movie. But you would think scientists would be the first to point this out. Yet they are the ones arguing aliens don't exist because they don't talk to us. Go figure.

I went on a reverse journey. For decades I subscribed to the argument that the universe is just *too* big for intelligent life to interact between systems (unless you got really really lucky and Starbucks-capable life evolved on a system just a few light years away and at roughly the same time as your own.) I think basically all rational people think there's smart life out there *somewhere*, but throughout the rise of empirical science it was looking less and less likely that it could ever be visiting us. The chances were just so infinitesimally small because space is just so infinitesimally huge.
Then these these military videos of UAPs got released.
And the thing about those videos is that while they don't make visits by aliens particularly *likely* they change the *chance* that we're being visited from powerball-winning unlikely to merely really really unlikely. Like, maybe grand-prize on a scratcher ticket unlikely. But that's *way* more likely than it was before the government admitted they had a bunch of footage of flying objects that they couldn't explain.
And that's where the fun begins, because now we can play this game that's like: well, what if those videos ARE alien spaceships? How could that be? And I argue that along your lines of thinking that if it IS alien spaceships, than that probably means FTL travel is possible. How rad would that be? I wrote it all up here:
