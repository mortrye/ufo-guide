# Mort Rye UFO blog (on Medium) Notes and todos file
Note: as of 2021-06-27 21:18:53 the text in these github pages files includes any updates on Medium.
These versions are the canonical versions.

## Todo:
* [X] re-learn how to push mdium to Medium
* [X] Add note to not foreign tech:
	* _So on further investigation if you discount the very few truly unexplainable phenomenon, it very well _could_ be foreign technology. And that story is shocking in its own right [link to The drive]._
* [ ] How to create a "ufo" category on Medium:
	* "A Pragmatic Guide to the UFOs"
* [ ] Set up profile on Medium:
	* [ ] adjust colors to Moria
	* [ ] Add profile image of some sort
		* (I think this should be a real human face, me or elsewise) 

## Notes on what to cover:
1. [X] because it's MORE interesting than the stuck boat, but few people are talking about it
	* [X] I have all these talking points when the conversation inevitably comes up with my friends
	* [X] there's very little actual info to go on, but what there is suggests a number of things that the media and govt aren't willing to consider (publicly).
	* [X] We live in a brief time where extra-terrestrials visiting the planet _is_ possible, let's revel in it
	* [X] Let's put aside visitations, encounters, abductions, and cattle mutilations --- the evidence is still too weak to seriously consider any of those.
2. [X] what we know is true now --- unexplained objects in the sky that go zip --- should be considered in light of the long history of people seeing these objects that do _exactly_ the same thing. 
	* [X] The really big takeaway from this article is that now it's pretty certain the government won't be walking an alien out on stage when it releases the report on June 25th. Other than that, the general sense that the report will include a _lot_ of documented yet impossible-to-believe things remains.
	* [X] while the government report, perhaps rightly so, is tasked with analyzing these military records, it is nearly impossible to put aside the reports from all classes of people, from farmers, to pilots, to military and police officials, for the last 70 years of objects that go zip
		* [X] this makes it unlikely that it's a foreign govt 
	* [X] Including people I know personally who have described seeing those things
		* this makes it unlikely that it's a foreign govt 
3. [X] What it is not -- foreign tech:
	* [X] hypersonic weapons are sci-fi fast, but there's no notion that they could accelerate instantly, turn on a dime in a new direction, and leave no exhaust plume. They take enormous amounts of power.
	* [X] To put it James Cameron terms, hypersonics are a T2-level technology. The feats of these objects documented by the military are a T1000-level technology.
	* [X] If it's foreign tech, they would have had to have had this technology for 50 years. 
	* [X] https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/40054/adversary-drones-are-spying-on-the-u-s-and-the-pentagon-acts-like-theyre-ufos
		* [X] The government report insists this is not the case
4. [X] What it is not -- optical illusions: (possibly combined with 5)
	* [X] Even though the hyper-skeptical are doubling-down on optical illusions and misidentifications,
	* [X] when the most highly trained pilots visuals match what multiple instrument systems are seeing, it's time to put the optical illusion theory on the back burner
	* [X] The hyper-skeptical have probably gone too far, and possibly have done damage to the ability of science to look at this stuff objectively
		* [X] (metorites again) 
	* [X] Maybe the reason we are talking about them today is because only now, after 80 years, has our technology caught up to the point where it _can_ have a chance at detecting these things.
5. [X] Science is culture
	* [X] Science is heavily influenced by culture and politics, don't let them ever tell you otherwise
	* [X] Scientists study what there is funding for. They do not study what would make their careers look ridiculous
	* [X] Farmers used to bring rocks to scientists and say "you know this rock looks like it comes from the sky"
		* [X] Only after hundreds of years of this did scientists acknowledge the existence of meteorites
6. [ ] The Times managed to once again write a headline that anyone not following this could easily skim over. I believe the military is telling the truth when they say they have no evidence that these things are aliens. But the article also strongly suggests they have no evidence that it's _not_ aliens. The headline could just have accurately been "UFOs are real people! But piloted by aliens? Yet to be determined.":
	* There's this weird thing about how people don't seem to want to talk about it.
7. [X] It's really NOT about whether aliens exist, it's about whether FTL travel is possible _at all_.
8. [X] Aliens might think of us as ants
	* [X] There's a lot of experts who say: if aliens are here, why don't they just land on the white house lawn and say hello?
	* [X] Well, EO Wilson is an expert in ants. But he almost certainly never tried to talk to their queen.
	* [X] It's possible we are like ant to aliens that have FTL capabilities. They are so far beyond us they really have no framework to communicate with us.
	* [X] They could be interested in studying us, and like the ant expert who is fascinated with ant warfare, they might be particularly interested in our war machines. But that could be just pure curiosity.
	* [X] Are they a threat?
		* [X] No. Again, If you consider the long history of these things, if they were a threat, we would already be threatened.
9. [ ] There's a certain kind of smart person who is going around spreading a certain kind of ignorance:
	* Not to get on the wrong side of [Neil DeGrasse Tyson](https://www.msnbc.com/the-beat-with-ari/watch/see-neil-degrasse-tyson-debunk-alien-believers-after-biden-pentagon-s-ufo-report-115788869792) but
	* It's just as plausible that we all know what aliens and UFOs look like because _that's what they are_.
	* We may have been "conditioned" to see aliens that way by _actually_ seeing them.
	* This isn't _science_ this is a science _lens_
		* The science lens on the world is based on rationality and likelihood
			* particularly for statistical based sciences, which is most of them
		* The problem with this is that scientists do the same thing with data that the rest of us do with experience: 
			* mistake what we've seen happen in the past for our predictions of what will happen in the future 
			* and predict with confidence that future outcomes will be in the likely category instead of an unlikely outcome [link to Trump election]
				* unlikely outcomes are unlikely, but they happen all the time.
		* Science views the world through a lens of what is _likely_ to be true. This often blinds them to unlikely outcomes.
	* Nobody ever imagines an alien with big muscles, but wouldn't aliens be far _less_ believable as a real thing if everyone's image of them was different?
		* Doesn't the fact that they are all the same actually suggest something weird is going on?
		* Isn't it a little strange how nobody is making a claim that the alien from aliens is real -- we all know that is a work of fiction -- but the type that gets claimed as real is the _same_ type over and over again?
	* The skeptic looks at the history of UFO reports and how they all look like UFOs on TV:
		* but maybe the UFOs on TV just _look like the real thing_
	* Also could include that bit you read about how people are always asking why airline pilots don't see them (they do) and why they aren't seen around the world (they are).
	* (This could actually be the _most_ powerful essay: take the perspective of the experts and turn it on its head. Give people an alternative explanation of the _real_ stuff going on that is _more_ compelling that the expert explanation.)
10. [ ] How the UFOs could be not-aliens:
	* Humans are great at recognizing patterns, even where there aren't any. It's possible that all the phenomneon are being chunked inappropriately, and in fact it is a bunch of things.
		* The government report lands in exactly this place
		* But it only takes a few instances of an object doing more than one impossible thing to shoot a hole in this idea. 
	* we only think aliens because that's what we've been talking about for 70 years.
	* But the universe is _weird_, if it's of an unknown origin, the origin _could_ be anything: pan-dimensional, from the deeps of the ocean, transports from the afterlife. There's no way to _know_ anything conclusive, so let's not jump to aliens.
	* Nature is extremely bizarre and surprising too. Let's not rule out cephalopods.
11. [ ] why now? pandemic? who knows, but it will be one of the interesting things we'll find out some day.
	* UFO sightings go in 5 years cycles: https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-ago-ufo-sightings-united-states-went-bust
	* Somewhere the government might have a powerpoint with a disclosure timeline. We might still be pretty early on the timeline.
		* Though this is less believable: https://www.nbcnews.com/news/weird-news/former-israeli-space-security-chief-says-extraterrestrials-exist-trump-knows-n1250333
12. [ ] The reason aliens are so exciting is because it would show us alternative models. We don't have to be the way we are.
	* (Though I'm not sure how our cultures through history and around the world don't already show us alternative models)	
13. [X]  ufos, next step after report release: start gathering all the reports ppl have from the last 80 years to one db
	* [X] It is the single fact that _so_ many observations of things that go zip --- particularly that zip part, the accelerations and maneuvers --- that strongly suggests these things are real and have been for a long time.
	* [X] https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD0688332.pdf
	* [X] There's not much evidence that the things that go zip are in space (at least, not that any astronaut is willing to admit)
		* [X] https://silvarecord.com/2020/09/20/are-satellites-tracking-ufos/
		* [X] Let's ask astronauts to come forward
	* [X] https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/35674/the-bizarre-mystery-of-unexplained-aerial-incursions-over-loring-air-force-base
	* [X] The report is most disappointing because its summer Friday drop date, its dullness, its careful parsing all suggest the government _doesn't_ want to talk about this.
		* [X] Which makes the powerpoint disclosure timeline hypothesis less likely.

## mdium
Installed this software:
https://github.com/icyphox/mdium
But only locally to dynohub. So it's installed in .local/bin/mdium which isn't in dynohub's PATH.
This software required python-pip which allows you to install python scripts on your system, apparently.
See readme.md for mdium. You need to set up the authentication token.
Publish with:
.local/bin/mdium publish file.md
mdium creates nice section breaks with medium using:
*****
And it does a good job with italics.
But --- gives you two emdashes for some reason -- you can use vim find and replace to replace --- with a unicode emdash character
And you need to give the file specific top matter --- see Tremble the Flowering Wood final upload file.
---
Looks like mdium is getting pretty old. This tool looks more up-to-date:

For Mort Rye Medium integration token see encrypted keys file under MEDIUM.

When copying to Medium from github pages version, you need to add a # title and remove the yaml at the top of the page.
