## Reponses under The existence of UFOs is not about whether aliens exist, itâ€™s about whether FTL travel is possible.

I think the problem at the root of a lot of conversations around UFO/UAPs (both in this comment section and the wider world) is that for more than 100 years science as a discipline has been continuously given the benefit of the doubt. The reality is scientists are no better at even-handedly examining, experimenting on, and adopting unusual claims today that they were 150 years ago when they scoffed at the idea that meteors could originate off-planet.

Even those who believe that a few experts know the truth and are hiding it from the public, or that black ops have all the answers figured out and want to keep the technology to themselves are falling into this trap of assuming that scientists are like actually GOOD at doing science.
I think science is far more influenced by squishy human concerns like cultural interests, political pressures, career advancement, and (seriously) pop culture than any scientist would ever care to admit. Rational, open-minded examination of evidence plays only the tiniest part in the decisions scientists make about what to study and how.

This, I think, is at the heart of why we know nothing about UFOs/UAPs -- "scientific" culture got in the way of actually considering the evidence. I think this is MUCH more of a problem than what the government isn't telling us.

Until science as a discipline starts to broadly integrate qualities of humility, curiosity, open-mindedness, and the recognition that being an expert is the _beginning_ of knowing something about a subject not the end, until then we will continue to face frustrating stone-walling and cultural obstacles to studying all sorts of the radically weird stuff that's going on in the world, and scientists will continue to have their asses handed to them when they make predictions and analysis based on what they think they know. (See 2016 election.)

You know what's fun? Faking UFO photos! Though I obviously lean into the making of funny, obviously-fake photos.

Good point. I guess just for the sake of simplicity I was lumping any method of travel that gets around the sheer time/distance problem of space as "FTL." But it's true that a "drive" that allows a vessel to move above light speed is not the only way to travel. (Though, I think, maybe the most exciting for those of us dreaming of the sci-fi future.)

There's also the chance that someone relatively close by -- say mere decades at sub-light speeds -- decided to send a ship or probe to check us out. But what a mundane idea! Travel through space by sheer perseverance and patience? Who wants to do that just to see what Netflix is line on another planet?
